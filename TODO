## TODO
##

* Find a decent name for this project!

* Get the document's PDFs from the server;

* Account for "Vigência condicional" status. Maybe a new field should be done
  do substitute "in_force" and use instead "status":

  1 - in force (default)
  2 - not in force
  3 - conditionally in force

##
## DONE
##

* Include a field "in_force". This info can be extracted from the document 
  number: 

  number: 12449/2002 (2ª Série)Diploma não vigente

  Example: claint = 70

* Make a list of failed documents, mantain a table with this list. Periodically
  the list should be re-downloaded. Make this N times then give up on the
  document.
